# DNS round robin - you can have two or more hosts that have the same DNS alias so that they respond to the same DNS name

# Create a new virtual network using the default bridge driver
docker network create round_robin

# Create two containers from elasticserch:2 image
# Resarch and use the '--net-alias search' when creating the containers to give them an additional DNS name to respond to
# run this twice
docker container run -d --rm --network round_robin --net-alias search elasticsearch:2


# Run the 'alpine nslookup search' with '--net' set to the same network that you assigned to the two containers.
docker container run --rm --net round_robin alpine nslookup search

# After you have the two containers resolving to the same alias 
# Run the 'centos curl -s search:9200' with the '--net' multiple times until you see both "name" fields show
docker container run -it --rm --network round_robin centos curl -s search:9200
