# Use jekyll "static site generator" to start a local web server

# Don't have to be web developer: this is example of bridging the gap between local file 
# access and apps running in containers.

# Source code is in the cours repo under bindmount-sample-1

$ We edit files with edtor on our host using native tools.

# Container detects changes with host files and updates web server

# start container with 
docker run -p 80:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve

# Refresh browser to see changes

# Change the file in _posts\ and referesh broswer to see changes.
